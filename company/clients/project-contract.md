## Every contract must define

	* What client wants to achieve with this project
	* Sequence of goals in project divided into milestones
* Developer's responsibilities
	* Milestone deadlines
	* Finance penalties
* Client's responsibilities
	* Milestone deadlines

	* Frontend compatibility
	* Backend compatibility
	* Server requirements (installed software)

### Notes
If content delivery relies on __client's__ responsibility and it is delayed deadline for current milestone will be shifted and some finance penalty __MUST__ be charged to __client__, because project is planned and such delays affects on planning for other projects, etc.   

The same responsibility __MUST__ be defined for __developer__ if deadline is delayed by __developer__ financing penalty __MUST__ be charged to __developer__.
