Working with [scrum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)) requires from project manager to follow scrum guidelines (amended for our company):

- Every project __MUST HAVE__: __versions__ _(at least one)_, __sprints__ _(at least one)_, __backlog__.  
- Every project starts with __MVP version__ _(Minimum Viable Product)_. Every version __MUST HAVE__ at least one sprint (milestone for client).
- All user stories for project dirived from [product manager](./product-manager.md).
- PM __MUST__ estimate (with a team) every story and convert each story into task(s), __MUST__ happen at [sprint perspective](#sprint-perspective).
- PM __MUST__ check every day the status of project, and if it delays the sprint PM finds a problem and solution and notifies [product manager](./product-manager.md) if deadline __must be__ shifted.

## Task requirements

## Sprint requirements

* Day includes maximum __6 hours__ for one person
* Minimum sprint length - __1 week__ (if less - too much time will be spent on perspectives and retrospectives, meetings)
	* __30 hours__ per person (including `hotfix`es)
* Maximum sprint length - __2 weeks__ (if more - less retrospective so no such rapid improvement of team)
	* __60 hours__ per person (including `hotfix`es)


## Sprint perspective

- All persons who participate in project must be present at sprint perspective.
- Every task is estimated by persons who able to do it (for example programmers) and the most negative estimate __MUST__ be chosen.


## Sprint retrospective

- Provide __solutions__ based on __sprint retrospective__.
- Create `teamfix` issues to implement __solutions__.
