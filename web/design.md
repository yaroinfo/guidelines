### Fonts

1. All font sizes need to be in remâ€™s
1. All line-height dimensions are to be specified without units of measurement
1. The font size in pixels should be divisible by 2 without residue
1. One type of text needs to have one line-height (e.g. heading 1.1)


### Colors

1. Basic colors should be defined (without transparency):
 - $theme-colors: (primary, secondary,  success,  info,  warning,  danger, light,  dark)  
 - $body-bg  
 - $body-color  
 - $link-color  
 - $link-hover-color

### Spacing

1. Use 1rem as base unit (base 16px)
1. All margin, padding (except gutter) to be calculated from the multiplicity to the base unit, for example:
 - 0.25 * 1rem,  
 - 0.5 * 1rem,
 - 1.5 * 1rem,  
 - 3 * 1rem etc.

 - xs: 0,  
 - sm: 576px,  
 - md: 768px,  
 - lg: 992px,  
 - xl: 1200px  
1. Their values can change, new ones can be added (e.g. xxl: 1921px)
1. For each breakpoint only one maximum width of the container can be specified
1. The basic grid is of 12 columns, the partitioning of blocks should be tied to a grid
1. The basic gutter is 30px, it can be replaced by any number that can be divided into 2 without remainder
